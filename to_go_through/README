After making two bam files, each containing reads with an informative SNP you can then
compare the read counts per region/gene of interest in an informative way. Either with
a fancy imprinting model (if you have a large dataset) or maybe even with something like
DESeq2 if you have replicates etc. OR a binomial GLM, something with a 1/0 outcome
which says if expression is biased from one allele or the other.
